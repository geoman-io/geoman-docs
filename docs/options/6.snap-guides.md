![Snap Guides Demo](https://geoman-static.onrender.com/assets/snap-guides-fast.gif)

Snap Guides are a powerful tool to create precise geometries. They are especially useful when drawing or editing shapes. Exclusive for Leaflet-Geoman Pro ⭐

Snap Guides are 90° guides that help you to align your shapes. They are displayed as dashed lines and snap to the orthogonal direction (90°) of the current vertex line.
